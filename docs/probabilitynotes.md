# Probability With CS Applications
Welcome to my compiled notes on Probability Theory and Applications. These are more or less my lecture notes from EECS 126 at UC Berkeley, which studied Probability Theory with applications specifically in CS. I added some more proofs included in separate notes.

## Why do Probability? ##

Probability theory is the mathematics surrounding randomness, chance, and uncertainty. It is one way we use the model and *reason about uncertainty*. It's used almost everywhere, from physics and chemistry, to the arrival of packets in networks, to finance.

I will be sharing everything I know about the field of probability in these notes, including some things that you might have never seen before. One of the great things about probability theory is that relatively simple models like the Markov chain and the Poisson process (both things I will detail in these notes) do a great job modeling many real life processes, and one can really marvel in amazement at the simplicity of such a thing.

I firmly believe learning is a process, not a product. You won't get everything the first time, nor will you learn everything just by reading through my notes (though I will try to make it as easy to understand as possible). Unfortunately, the EECS Department will not be very happy if I reuse their exercises, but there are plenty of exercises in probability theory on the Internet and textbooks you can look to for exercises and/or supplemental material. Please do them... you will only be doing yourself a favor.

Buckle up, get excited. You're about to embark on a wild journey through the world of uncertainty.

In general, we will use $\mathbb{P}$ to denote probability.
